# Polar_Code
My research focused on 5G channel coding and decoding techniques, specifically Polar codes, as well as pulse noise suppression algorithms. I used Visual Studio to write and simulate C language programs, implementing signal encoding and decoding techniques using Polar codes. I also investigated the impact of two types of noise simulation receivers on the bit error rate in various scenarios. By incorporating known or unknown information parameters into channel selection and receivers, I aimed to find optimal designs for two decoding algorithms.
